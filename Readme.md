# Dio Bank App

This code challenge was proposed by Digital Innovation One (@DIO) on their TypeScript Bootcamp.

The main objective was to practice the recently acquired knowledge on TypeScript.

Created a simple application simulating a bank app entirely with TypeScript.

I would like to thank teacher @nathyts for the lessons learned.
